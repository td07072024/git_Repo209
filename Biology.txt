Babirusas are native to Sulawesi, some of the Togian Islands, the Sula Islands, and Buru.[8] In Sulawesi, they range from the Minahasa Peninsula to the provinces of South Sulawesi and Southeast Sulawesi. Although they are present on both Sulawesi and Sula, they are not found on the large islands between the two, the Banggai Archipelago. It has been hypothesized that the unusual distribution may be due to their being transported by humans as gifts bestowed by native royalty.[12] The preferred habitat of babirusa is tropical rainforest along river banks.[8] It appears that they have been confined to the higher grounds in the interior despite occurring in lowland areas near coasts in the past.[8] They are active during the daytime. Like all pig species, babirusa has an omnivorous diet with an intestinal tract similar to that of the domestic pig.[13] The stomach diverticulum of a babirusa is enlarged which may indicate that it is a ruminant but evidence shows otherwise.[8] Because it does not have a rostral bone in the nose, a babirusa does not dig with its snout like other pigs do except in mud and swampy grounds. The diet of the babirusa includes leaves, roots, fruits and animal material. The strong jaws of a babirusa are capable of easily cracking hard nuts.[8]

Males tend to live solitarily while adult females can be found in groups with young.[14] Groups of females and young may number up to 84 individuals, most of which contain no adult males. Males rarely travel in pairs or trios.[14] There are almost never more than three adult females in a group.[15] The tusks of the adult males are used in intraspecific fighting. The upper tusks are for defense while the lower tusks are offensive weapons.[16] If a male babirusa does not grind his tusks (achievable through regular activity), they can eventually keep growing and, rarely, penetrate the individual's skull.[17]

Female babirusa cycle lengths are between 28 and 42 days and estrus last 2â€“3 days.[8] The litter size for a babirusa is usually one or two piglets.
