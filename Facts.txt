The babirusas, also called deer-pigs (Indonesian: babi rusa[2]), are a genus, Babyrousa, in the swine family found in the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi, Togian, Sula and Buru.[3] All members of this genus were considered part of a single species until 2002, the babirusa, B. babyrussa, but following that was split into several species. This scientific name is restricted to the Buru babirusa from Buru and Sula, whereas the best-known species, the North Sulawesi babirusa, is named B. celebensis.[4] The males have prominent upwards incurving canine tusks, which pierce the flesh in the snout.[5]

All species of babirusa are listed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
