In Indonesia, the striking appearance of the babirusa has inspired demonic masks.[18]

The Balinese Hindu-era Court of Justice pavilion and the "floating pavilion" of Klungkung palace ruins are notable for painted babirusa raksasa (grotesques) on the ceilings.[12]

Prehistoric paintings of babirusa found in caves on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia have been dated back at least 35,400 years (to the ice age Pleistocene epoch). Adam Brumm [d], who co-authored the 2014 study dating the paintings, said "The paintings of the wild animals are most fascinating because it is clear they were of particular interest to the artists themselves."[19]

The babirusa has sparked debate among Jewish scholars and animal researchers about whether it is considered kosher, or permissible to be consumed by Jews, according to Jewish dietary laws. The debate centers around whether the animal chews its cud, which is a requirement according to the Old Testament for an animal to be considered kosher. Some experts, like J. David Bleich, a professor of Jewish law and ethics at Yeshiva University, believe that the babirusa does not meet the physical criteria to be considered kosher, challenging the assertion that the babirusa chews its cud by citing a report from 1940 that found that true rumination could not take place in the animal's stomach. However, he also notes that Jews can eat any food that is not expressly forbidden and that "the babirusa's resemblance to a pig in appearance and taste is not sufficient grounds for banning its consumption as kosher meat." Others, such as Fuller Bazer, an animal science professor at the University of Florida, believe that the animal is kosher due to its cloven hoof and cud chewing. Additionally, it has been noted that the babirusa is an endangered species and that most Muslims, who face similar dietary restrictions, would avoid eating the meat of any animal whose status in religious law is uncertain.
