Babirusas are notable for the long upper canines in the males. The upper canines of males emerge vertically from the alveolar process, penetrating through the skin and curving backward over the front of the face and towards the forehead.[8][9] The lower canines also grow upwards. The canines of females are either reduced or absent.[8] The structure of the male's canines varies by species. In the golden babirusa, the upper canines are short and slender with the alveolar rotated forward to allow the lower canines to cross the lateral view.[8] The Togian babirusa also has the same characteristics and the upper canines always converge. The North Sulawesi babirusa has long and thick upper canines with a vertically implanted alveolar. This causes the upper canines to emerge vertically and not cross with the lower canines.[10]

Babirusas also vary by species in other characteristics. The golden babirusa has a long, thick pelage that is white, creamy gold, black or gold overall, and black at the rump.[8] The pelage of the Togian babirusa is also long but not as that of the golden babirusa. The Togian babirusa has a tawny, brown, or black pelage that is darker on the upper parts than in the lower parts.[8] The North Sulawesi babirusa has very short hair and appears bald. The female babirusa has only one pair of teats.
