The genus is monotypic within the subfamily Babyrousinae, or alternatively considered to form a tribe, Babyrousini, of the subfamily Suinae. To date, only one fossil skull has been found to suggest a larger ancestor.[7]

All members of the genus were considered part of a single species, the babirusa or pig-deer, B. babyrussa. After they were split into several species, this scientific name is restricted to the Buru babirusa from Buru and the Sula Islands, whereas the best-known species, the north Sulawesi babirusa, is named B. celebensis.[4] The split, which uses the phylogenetic species concept, is based on differences in size, amount of hair on the body and tail-tuft, and measurements of the skull and teeth.
